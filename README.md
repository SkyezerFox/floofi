## About

floofi is an isomorphic wrapper for the Discord API. Behind the scenes, the library uses [discord.js](https://discord.js.org), [eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris), and/or [discordie](https://github.com/qeled/discordie), allowing for simultaneous and consistent development using either of the three libraries, while adding features that the child libraries don't have themselves.

## Isomorphic Rewrite

The rewrite in order to enable the isomorphic behaviour described is still underway - **this is very much a work in progress library.** I cannot guaruntee that anything works as it should.
